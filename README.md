=== Description ===

A -very- small plugin to see which template and files are included are used to display the current page.

The name comes from the ancient Greek Deíknūmi (δέκνῡμῐ). Proto-Indo-European *deyḱ- (“to show, point out”) +‎ -νῡμῐ (-nūmi), from Proto-Indo-European *-néwti.

This, ultimately, is intended to be a toolbox with various tools needed during WordPress development. Everyone is welcome to contribute.
