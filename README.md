# show-template

A -very- small plugin to see which template and files are included are used to display the current page. Heavily inspired by the guys at MagicPress.net.

The name comes from the ancient Greek Deíknūmi (δέκνῡμῐ). Proto-Indo-European *deyḱ- (“to show, point out”) +‎ -νῡμῐ (-nūmi), from Proto-Indo-European *-néwti.
